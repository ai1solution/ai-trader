# Why V11.2 Holds Winners Without Increasing Risk

## The Core Philosophy
In V11.0, "Safety" and "Profit" were in conflict. To be safe, we had to exit early. 
In **V11.2**, we separate **Capital Safety** (Hard Stops, Portfolio Caps) from **Trend Patience** (Signal Decay).

We achieved this by introducing **Context Awareness**. The engine now "knows" if a trade is High Quality or Low Quality and treats them differently.

## Key Upgrades

### 1. The Entry Quality Score (EQS)
Not all signals are equal. V11.2 calculates an **Entry Quality Score (EQS)** at the moment of entry:
- **HIGH**: Strong Velocity + Accelerating + Tight Spread + Trending Regime.
- **LOW**: Borderline Velocity OR Wide Spread OR Chop Regime.

**Impact:** 
- **High Quality** trades are given "VIP Status"—the engine loosens the leash, allowing them to survive minor pullbacks.
- **Low Quality** trades are on a "Short Leash"—if momentum fades even slightly, they are cut immediately to prevent drawdown.

### 2. Profit-Aware Signal Decay
Previously, `SIGNAL_DECAY` was a static number. Now, it adapts based on **Unrealized Profit**:
- **Phase 1 (No Profit)**: If the EQS is High, we tolerate a drop to 30% of entry velocity. We give the trade room to breathe.
- **Phase 2 (Profit > 0.5%)**: The moment the trade is green, the engine shifts to "Protective Mode." It demands higher velocity to stay in the trade.

**Result**: We give winners room to grow, but once they pay, we don't let them turn into losers.

### 3. ARM Acceleration & Timeout
We found that V11.0 often got "stuck" in the ARM state, waiting for a signal that never came.
- **Acceleration**: We now require velocity to be *increasing* (accelerating), not just high. This kills flat, high-velocity noise.
- **Timeout**: If a symbol sits in ARM for >30 seconds without triggering an entry, it is forced into a micro-cooldown. This clears the mental RAM of the engine.

### 4. Micro Profit-Take
If a trade is up **>0.8%** but velocity starts to waver, the engine instinctively tightens the Stop Loss to **Entry + 0.5%**. 
This "banks" a small win automatically, converting stressful borderline trades into guaranteed (albeit small) profits.

## Summary
V11.2 is not "riskier"—it is **smarter**. It risks the same amount of capital (ATR Stops) but spends its "Patience Budget" much more efficiently, allocating it only to the trades that have earned it.
